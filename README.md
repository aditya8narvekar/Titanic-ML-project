# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
**My first end-to-end Machine Learning project using Kaggle's Titanic dataset.**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a classification model.
I explored the dataset, cleaned it, engineered useful features, trained a Random Forest model, and submitted predictions to Kaggle.

**Final Kaggle Score:** `0.77751`

## What I Learned
- Data cleaning using `pandas`
- Feature encoding and missing value imputation
- Building and tuning a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluating models using accuracy score
- Submitting predictions to Kaggle

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Files in This Repo
- `titanic-ml-from-disaster.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all steps
- `submission.csv` – Final Kaggle submission
- `README.md` – This file

## What's Next
- Try Logistic Regression for comparison
- Engineer new features
- Improve score with advanced techniques
